This app allows you to keep track of player scores in any high- or lowscore game. The app consists of a simple table where every player has a column and each round is a line. At the bottom, the app shows the sum of points and a ranking of the players.

That's it, keep it simple, stupid!

Features:
- Enter player scores in a table
- (Theoretically) unlimited number of players (practically limited by your screen width)
- Sum of points
- Ranking according to the game mode (high-/lowscore)
- Save multiple games and switch between them
- No unnecessary permissions
- Fully open source
- Privacy friendly: All data is stored on your device, the app doesn't even have permission to access the internet!
