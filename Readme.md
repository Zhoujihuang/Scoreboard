# Scoreboard
A simple app to keep track of player scores during any high- or lowscore game.

Following the KISS-principle, this app consists of a simple table in which
every player has a column and each round is a line. At the bottom, the app shows the 
sum of points and a ranking of the players. That's it, keep it simple, stupid!

## Features
- Enter player scores in a table
- (Theoretically) unlimited number of players (practically limited by your screen width)
- Sum of points
- Ranking according to the game mode (high-/lowscore)
- Save multiple games and switch between them
- No unnecessary permissions
- Fully open source

## Becoming an Alpha-Tester
The app is already available on Google Play, but only in private test mode,
as it's not finished yet. However, if you wish to try it out now, just 
write a quick email to [scoreboard@fredplus10.me](mailto:scoreboard@fredplus10.me) 
with your google account so that I can whitelist you as an alpha-tester.

## Will this application be available on F-Droid?
Yes, but publishing on F-Droid isn't as straightforward as publishing 
on Google Play is, so hang tight :)
