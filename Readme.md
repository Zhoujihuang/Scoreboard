# Scoreboard [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/vatbub/Scoreboard.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/vatbub/Scoreboard)
Updated for MCR game.

A simple app to keep track of player scores during any high- or lowscore game.

Following the KISS-principle, this app consists of a simple table in which
every player has a column and each round is a line. At the bottom, the app shows the 
sum of points and a ranking of the players. That's it, keep it simple, stupid!

## Features
- Enter player scores in a table
- (Theoretically) unlimited number of players (practically limited by your screen width)
- Sum of points
- Ranking according to the game mode (high-/lowscore)
- Save multiple games and switch between them
- No unnecessary permissions
- Fully open source
- Privacy friendly: All data is stored on your device, the app doesn't even have permission to access the internet!
